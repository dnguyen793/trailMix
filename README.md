# trailMix

trailMix is a trail-finding based web application built by a team of 5 web developers during a 48 hour hackathon. The project was originally completed utilizing JavaScript and jQuery, and was later ported over to ReactJS and Redux.

## Usage

Our application was created for any level of hiker to find a trail either nerby them or any location they choose.  Your next hike is just a few clocks away.  Sort by trail rating, length or difficulty to match your needs.  Get directions to the trail using Google Maps and make sure to select a date for your hike to get the weather in the area!
